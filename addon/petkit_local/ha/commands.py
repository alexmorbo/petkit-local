"""Translate HA entity commands into device commands.

Routing is driven by the entity definition (its `component` and `value_path`),
not by parsing an opaque payload. Every command that should reach the device
returns ``(service_suffix, mqtt_envelope)`` — the caller publishes it to
``/sys/{pk}/{dn}/thing/service/{suffix}`` (or falls back to the heartbeat queue
if the MQTT bridge is down). This matches the reference localkit stack, which
delivers ALL real-time control over MQTT `thing/service/*` topics, not heartbeat.

- **button**  -> a named action (litter start/end, feed, …).
- **switch/number/select** -> a settings write via `property.set`, with an
  optimistic local update so the HA entity reflects it immediately.
- **text** (schedules) -> raw JSON written to device config, served by
  dev_schedule_get / dev_feed_get.

Action codes and envelopes are cross-checked against pypetkitapi `LBCommand`
and localkit `ServiceStart/End/FeedRealtime/PropertySet`.
